# Identifying the clothing style using Fashion-MNIST dataset

## Introduction
In this notebook, I have implemented a neural network model using pytorch which classifies the cloth according to the clothing type. 

## Dataset
The model is trained on Fashion-MNIST dataset. [link](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)
